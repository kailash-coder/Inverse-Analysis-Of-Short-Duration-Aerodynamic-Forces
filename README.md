# Inverse Analysis Of Short-Duration Aerodynamic Forces

This is my Bachelor's Thesis Project at IIT-Guwahati which I'm pursuing under the guidance of Dr. Niranjan Sahoo.
The objective is to study the behavior of short-duration impulse forces and their recovery. 
Me and my BTP partner have so far acquired data experimentally and also by building a blunt cone model using CAD and acquired data using ANSYS.
We have tried to incorporate Machine Learning Models and show why they are better/more accurate as compared to traditional mechanical methods, like deconvolution.
I am attaching the web interface I deployed using Streamlit while recovering the forces using XGBoost.

In our future work, we expect to bring down the RMSE value and acquire more data using ANSYS(cone angle, different components of stress, strain, and test for different materials). We also plan to build a neural network.
